        "title": "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate",
        "url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473v7",
        "summary": "Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine\ntranslation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural\nmachine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be\njointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed\nrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of\nencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into\na fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this\npaper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in\nimproving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and\npropose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for\nparts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,\nwithout having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new\napproach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing\nstate-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French\ntranslation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the\n(soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.",
